    "The Alerter is a simple monitoring tool, intended to help detect increases in response time for some process. It does that\n",
    "by computing a few statistics about the process across a 'window' of a certain number of runs, and alerting (returning true)\n",
    "if certain thresholds are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes the following parameters: \n",
    " - inputs: A list of integer times for the process. This list may be very long \n",
    " - window size: how many runs long a window is, as an integer \n",
    " - allowedIncrease: how far over 'average' a window or value is allowed to be, as a percent. This is represented as a decimal value based on one, so a 50% allowable increase would be represented as 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Alerter should return true if either of the following conditions are met:\n",
    " * Any value is more than the allowed increase above the window average in ALL windows in which it appears.\n",
    "     For example:\n",
    "         alert({1, 2, 100, 2, 2}, 3, 1.5) should alert: the value 100 appears in three windows, and in all cases is more than 50% over the average value\n",
    "         alert({1, 2, 4, 2, 2}, 3, 2) should not alert: the largest outlier is 4, and that value appears in a window with average value 2.6, less than 100% of that average\n",
    " * Any window's average is more than the acceptable increase over a previous window's average value\n",
    "     For example:\n",
    "         alert({1,2,100,2,2}, 2, 2.5) should alert: Even though no individual value causes an alert, there is a window with average 1.5 and a later window with an average more than 2.5 times larger\n",
    "Otherwise, you should return false."
